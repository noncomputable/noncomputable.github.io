### Hi there!

I'm Andrew, and I'm into computational social science.

I want a robust understanding of how social systems _work_ and how they can be _improved_.  

I try to augment my ability to do both of these things with machines that can do the computation better than I can.

I'm interested in how we can evaluate our own institutions---scientific, economic, and political---and how we might be able to design better ones.

I broadly agree with the principles of [Effective Altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism).

I use Python and JavaScript, and sometimes [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

I like [Scott Walker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRPXfsCBvVU), [Marty Robbins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x6o_tBU8DU), and [Leonard Cohen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOnXe8ttmjY).

If you want to talk, say hi at:
