Working on big projects off the beaten path, whether in tech or art, can be an isolating journey. Despite the high density of people, NYC can feel like a lonely, transactional place. I want to write about a community of technologists, founders, and artists I've been building in the city over the last year. 

My goal with Midnight Cafe was to create a local community that fosters lasting connections and can be a foundation for builders' sense of community and belonging. I've hosted close to 30 events and have curated a community of people I like and trust in tech, academia, and the arts. The result has been very satisfying: too many new friendships to count, romantic relationships, business partnerships, funding raised, artworks sold, startups acquired, and even one marriage.

I couldn't have done it without the friends I've made who have taken the mantle and helped me organize this: Kasra, Santi, and Avery. We met through the Interact Fellowship community which is a lot more globally distributed and wanted to create something similar that was local and persistent. 

We’ve experimented with a wide variety of event formats, including discussion salons, demo nights, and curated coworking sessions.

Sharing on social media has helped us expand our community and find support. We’ve found a number of spaces (coworking spaces, VC offices), that have generously hosted us:

All in all, this project has given me what I was looking for in a community, and helped free many of my new friends to pursue their dreams and ambitions by giving them a sense of stable community and belonging.
